# DevOps & SRE Real-Time Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my **DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Projects** repository. This collection features 14+ real-world projects demonstrating my experience in automating infrastructure, creating CI/CD pipelines, deploying containerized applications, and implementing monitoring and security systems in cloud environments.

Iâ€™m Vishal Gunjal, a passionate **DevOps and SRE learner**. Through these projects, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitOps, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and more. For more about me, check out my [portfolio](https://vishalgunjalswe.vercel.app/).

## Project Descriptions

### 1. [Jenkins DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline](#jenkins-devsecops-cicd-pipeline)

Set up a secure CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and JFrog Artifactory on an AWS EC2 instance. Integrated DevSecOps practices, including static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.

### 2. [Jenkins Pipeline with Monitoring](#jenkins-pipeline-with-monitoring)

Created a Jenkins pipeline integrated with monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus) to ensure observability and real-time metrics for deployed applications.

### 3. [Docker Advanced Project](#docker-advanced-project)

Worked on advanced Docker features, including multi-stage builds, Docker Compose, and container orchestration with Docker Swarm.

### 4. [Kubernetes EKS Deployment & Microservice Architecture](#kubernetes-eks-deployment--microservice-architecture)

Deployed a microservices-based 3-tier application on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with data visualization on network traffic using Prometheus and Grafana.

### 5. [Kubernetes Istio + Jaeger Monitoring](#kubernetes-istio--jaeger-monitoring)

Implemented Istio as a service mesh for traffic management and integrated Jaeger for distributed tracing and monitoring.

### 6. [ArgoCD with GitOps Deployments](#argocd-with-gitops-deployments)

Automated Kubernetes deployments using GitOps principles with ArgoCD, enabling continuous delivery from GitHub.

### 7. [Python Real-Time Programming](#python-real-time-programming)

Developed Python scripts for real-time system automation tasks, improving system efficiency and monitoring.

### 8. [Kubernetes CRDs, Operators, and Security](#kubernetes-crds-operators-and-security)

Explored Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Operators for automation, and advanced security mechanisms like RBAC and Network Policies.

### 9. [Helm Charts & Multi-Pod Deployments](#helm-charts--multi-pod-deployments)

Designed Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments, focusing on managing multi-pod applications and enforcing RBAC for role-based access control.

### 10. [ELK Stack Monitoring & Grafana + Prometheus](#elk-stack-monitoring--grafana--prometheus)

Set up a complete monitoring solution using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) along with Grafana and Prometheus for comprehensive observability.

### 11. [AWS Infrastructure with Terraform](#aws-infrastructure-with-terraform)

Provisioned and managed AWS infrastructure using Terraform, automating VPC, EC2, and S3 creation with version control.

### 12. [Azure Infrastructure with Terraform](#azure-infrastructure-with-terraform)

Automated the creation and management of Azure infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring efficient resource allocation and management.

### 13. [Shell Scripting Real-Time Scenarios](#shell-scripting-real-time-scenarios)

Automated various real-time tasks using Shell scripting, including managing user accounts, disk partitions, and automating Jira portal creation for project management.

### 14. [Ansible Automation and Roles Creation](#ansible-automation-and-roles-creation)

Used Ansible for automating configuration management and creating reusable roles for deploying applications across multiple environments.

### 15. [Java Spring Boot with Splunk Integration](#java-spring-boot-with-splunk-integration)

Integrated a Java Spring Boot application with Splunk for real-time log aggregation and monitoring.

### 16. [Java + Database Deployment on Kubernetes](#java--database-deployment-on-kubernetes)

Deployed a Java application with a connected database on Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and high availability.

### 17. [Red Hat Linux Automations + Terraform CI/CD](#red-hat-linux-automations--terraform-cicd)

Automated Red Hat Linux configurations, including disk management and user access, with a CI/CD pipeline using Terraform for Azure infrastructure provisioning.
