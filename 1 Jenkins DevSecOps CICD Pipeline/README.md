> # CI/CD Pipeline Setup with Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, Maven, and Trivy

This project demonstrates the setup of a robust **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** using a variety of DevOps tools. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a Java application, ensuring code quality, security, and efficiency throughout the software development lifecycle.

The pipeline integrates the following tools:

* **Jenkins**: For orchestrating the CI/CD process.
* **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
* **SonarQube**: For static code analysis and code quality checks.
* **Maven**: For building the Java application.
* **Trivy**: For scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities.

The project is hosted on an **AWS EC2 instance** (Ubuntu t2.medium). The pipeline is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient, making it suitable for both small and large-scale projects.

This CI/CD pipeline setup ensures a streamlined and automated workflow for building, testing, and deploying Java applications. By integrating tools like Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, Maven, and Trivy, the pipeline enhances code quality, security, and deployment efficiency.
